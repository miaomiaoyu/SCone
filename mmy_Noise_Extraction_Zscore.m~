function zscoreIndices = mmy_Noise_Extraction_Zscore (dataVector, zscore)

% A function that takes in a vector V, and calculates the difference between
% V(i) and V(i+1), and finds out the zscore. 

% A good way to use this is to input the data vector of the blink
% electrode. You can pick out the indices (blinkIndices) of when blink noise is more than
% one standard deviation away from the mean, indicating a 'big enough'
% blink noise. You can choose to remove these or change them to the mean
% value. 

% Z-score less than 0 represents an element less than the mean. 
% Z-score more than 0 represents an element greater than the mean. 
% 68% of elements have Z score from between -1 and 1;
% 95% of elements have Z score from between -2 and 2;
% 99% of elements have Z score from between -3 and 3.

diffVector = diff(dataVector);
zscoreData = zscore(dataVector);

% zscoreIndices are indices of the data where z score is beyond the denoted
% range.
zscoreIndices = find(zscoreData < zscore & zscoreData > -zscore);
